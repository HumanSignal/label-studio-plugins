<!-- Explanation:
This labeling configuration is designed to allow annotators to
evaluate the sentiment of a given text while also providing an option
for additional comments. The configuration includes the following key
components:

1. **Text Tag**: The `<Text>` tag displays the text that
needs to be annotated. It binds to the `value` parameter using the
variable `$text`, which will be populated with the actual text data
during annotation.

2. **Header Tag**: The `<Header>` tag provides a
title or instruction for the annotators, indicating that they should
choose the sentiment of the text.

3. **Choices Tag**: The `<Choices>`
tag allows annotators to select a sentiment from predefined options.
In this case, the choices are "Positive" and "Negative". The `toName`
attribute links this choice to the `text` object, ensuring that the
sentiment is directly associated with the displayed text.

4.
**TextArea Tag**: The `<TextArea>` tag is added to allow annotators to
provide additional comments or feedback related to their sentiment
choice. This tag is also linked to the `text` object, ensuring that
all annotations are connected to the same text input. The `rows`
attribute specifies the height of the text area, and the `placeholder`
attribute provides a hint to the annotators about what to enter.

Overall, this configuration enhances the annotation process by
allowing for both sentiment classification and qualitative feedback,
making it a comprehensive tool for text analysis.
